1)Summary of Bash Script: Strava GPX File Organizer(team_assignment_week_3 comments.sh)

Overview
This Bash script is designed to organize, backup, and analyze GPX activity files from Strava. The script automates the process of:

Backing up GPX files
Renaming them systematically
Sorting them into categorized activity folders (e.g., running, cycling, hiking)
Extracting metadata (start time, number of track points)
Generating a summary file sorted by activity data
This ensures the structured storage and easy retrieval of fitness tracking data.

2)Summary of the Python GPX Data Processing Code(Team17 week4 (1).ipynb)
This Python script processes GPX (GPS Exchange Format) files from Strava to extract and analyze fitness tracking data. The script reads a GPX file, converts it into a structured DataFrame, extracts relevant metadata, computes time intervals, and determines the corresponding time zones.


3)Summary of Python Script: Strava GPX Data Analysis (1team17week5.ipynb)
Overview

This Python script processes GPX files from Strava to analyze and extract key running or cycling performance metrics. It automates the following:

Reading and parsing GPX files using gpxcsv.
Converting GPS points into a GeoDataFrame for spatial analysis.
Calculating cumulative distance between consecutive GPS points using the Haversine formula.
Identifying the fastest intervals for specified distances (1 mile, 0.5 mile, 0.25 mile, and 100 meters).
Formatting and displaying results in a readable format, including start and end times.
